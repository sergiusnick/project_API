This game is somewhat used to bring geographical educaton
into the minds of the young and old.

It is a fun way to solve geographical problems of finding
a specific subject on the map of the world.

Here's a quick look on what is presented in the game:

        You start in the main menu.
        
        You may exit the game anytime.
        
        You can choose the language you would love to see
        the game being presented in. There are two options:
        English and Russian.
        
        You may also read the rules or, more specificly, your 
        objective in the game by pressing a corresponding button
        in the main menu.
       
        Pressing "Play" or "Играть" button will lead you to another
        screen where you will be able to choose a gamemode of your taste.
        [ESC] will get you back to the menu. Don't hesitate to press it.
        The first gamemode, "Capitals"/"Столицы", will ask you to find a
        capital it will have chosen for you by that moment. It's name will
        appear in the upper left corner. The second one will now not give you
        the name of the capital, but instead it will give you the name of any
        russian city there is randomly. The last gamemode is implemented to have
        some fun, truly. It will show you a picture of some city sight and then you
        will have to guess where the city hosting the sight is located.
        Good luck to you though!
        
        Note:
                In all of the gamemodes you have limited time. The timer is
                located in the upper right corner of your screen during the
                game. When it reaches zero, the game will be stopped and
                results will be now shown.
                
        [LMB] click onto a point on the map will lead to putting a mark there.
        Such mark is your answer. If you get it right, you get many points.
        If you miss, unfortunately, you don't get as many.
        
        After you have tried your luck and knowledge, you will see a purple line
        connecting a red mark and a green one. The green mark will be showing the
        location of the place you will have looked for and the red one will be
        your answer.
        
        It is strictly same for all gamemodes.
       
Quick look finished. Done. This is about it, really. Indeed, good luck! 
Speak thine heart's desire!
